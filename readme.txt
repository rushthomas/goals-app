Importing:
    Whenever you're importing something, you set it equal to a variable

.
    this means look in the same directory


git push heroku master
    push all code in current directory to heroku


ejs
    embedded javascript
    when you want to refer to a variable, use <%= %>
    when you simply insert JS, use <% %>
